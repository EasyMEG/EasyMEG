# EasyMEG

### Welcome to EasyMEG Home Page.
EasyMEG is an easy-to-use software for MEG analysis based on FieldTrip and Matlab GUI.

***This is not yet a complete project. Development is still being carried out.***

You are welcome to visit our project page and post your questions or suggestions.
### FieldTrip
[FieldTrip](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) is a great open source toolbox for MEG analysis.
With this toolbox, you can do almost any analysis you need. 
It's a command-based toolbox, you can write analysis scripts to do the analysis, which is flexible for advanced users. 
EasyMEG is a project based on FieldTrip, devoting to create a easy-to-use software for MEG analysis.

***Please also cite the FieldTrip Reference Paper when you have used EasyMEG for data analysis in your study.***
